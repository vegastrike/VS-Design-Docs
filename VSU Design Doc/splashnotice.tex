{\rm 

The authors wish to thank, in no particular order, a large number of
much more accomplished authors, without whom it is unlikely we'd have
ever set out on such an undertaking as this: David Brin, Isaac Asimov,
Arthur C. Clarke, Larry Niven, Gregory Benford, Robert A. Heinlein,
John Varley, Frank Herbert, C.J. Cherryh, Dan Simmons, Robert
L. Forward, Greg Bear, Roger Zelazny, Joe Haldeman, Mike Resnick, Ben
Bova, Robert Silverberg, Poul Anderson, Stanislav Lem, David Weber --
we owe you all much.
